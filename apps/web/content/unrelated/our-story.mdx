## Our Story 📖

AffEasy was born out of real-world frustration and a desire for a better solution. As an affiliate marketer myself, I faced the daily challenge of juggling multiple tools for different affiliate networks. The process was tedious and time-consuming - I found myself using up to 10 different tools just to create and manage my affiliate links.

This firsthand experience sparked an idea: what if there was a single tool that could handle all of these tasks efficiently? That's how AffEasy came to life - a solution created by an affiliate marketer, for affiliate marketers.
