## 2. Add an Affiliate Network

Connect an affiliate network to your AffEasy account by following [this](/guickstart/connect-affiliate-network) guide.

## 3. Open the Link Builder

There are 3 ways to open the link builder to create an affiliate link:

- **Slowest:** Click the "Create link" button on the dashboard.
- **Faster:** Use the keyboard shortcut **c** to open the link builder.
- **Fastest:** Paste a valid URL into the dashboard. This will automatically open the link builder and pre-fill the URL.

  />
</Frame>

You’ll also see a preview of how your short link will appear on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and LinkedIn.

## 4. Enter Your Destination URL

Type the URL in the "Destination URL" field. You can include or leave out the `https://` – AffEasy will format it correctly for you.

## 5. Set a Short Link Slug

In the Short Link field, you can:

- Type your own short link slug.
- Generate a random one.

This step is optional. If you skip it, AffEasy will generate a slug for you.

  />
</Frame>

## 6. Customize Your Link Previews

You can control how your links appear on social media by setting custom social media cards. This is optional and works for platforms like X, LinkedIn, Slack, Telegram, iMessage, and more.

## 7. Add Tags to Your Link

You can add tags to organize your links and make them easier to find.

- Tip: You can assign multiple tags to one AffEasy link.
- Bonus: Filter analytics by tags to create detailed, campaign-specific reports.
