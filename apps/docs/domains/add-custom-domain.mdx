## Step 1: Add a Custom Domain

Once you have a custom domain, you can add it to your AffEasy project by following these steps:

1. Navigate to your workspace's Domains page – you can do that by clicking on the Domains link in the menu bar at the top of your workspace dashboard.
2. Click on the Add Domain button.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="/images/domains/domain-dashboard.png"
    alt="Link Builder"
    width="1200"
    height="630"
  />
</Frame>

3. Enter the domain you want to use and click Add domain.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="/images/domains/add-domain.png"
    alt="Link Builder"
    width="1200"
    height="630"
  />
</Frame>

## Step 2: Configure Your Domain

After adding your domain, you'll be presented with a DNS record that you'll need to add to your domain's DNS settings.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="/images/domains/domain-config.png"
    alt="Link Builder"
    width="1200"
    height="630"
  />
</Frame>

**Step 2a: Adding an Apex Domain**\
If you're adding an apex domain (e.g. example.com), you'll need to add an A record with the following values:

- **Name**: @ (or leave it blank)
- **Value**: 76.76.21.21
- **TTL**: 86400 (or the highest value possible)

**Step 2b: Adding a Subdomain**\
If you're adding a subdomain (e.g. go.example.com), you'll need to add a CNAME record with the following values:

- **Name**: go (or whatever subdomain you want to use)
- **Value**: cname.affeasy.link
- **TTL**: 86400 (or the highest value possible)

Note that we do not support using www. as a subdomain, since the www. subdomain will always redirect to the apex domain instead.

We recommend using the following variations for your subdomains:

- go.example.com
- try.example.com
- links.example.com
- l.example.com

<Warning>
  If you're using Cloudflare as your DNS provider, you might need to configure
  some extra steps for it to work properly. Please refer to our [guide on using
  Cloudflare domains](/domains/cloudflare-domains) with AffEasy for more
  information.
</Warning>

## Step 3 (Optional): Verify Domain Ownership

This step is only applicable if you are adding a domain that is currently being used on another platform that requires verification.
To verify that you own the domain, you'll need to add a TXT record with the following
values:

- Name: \_vercel
- Value: vc-domain-verify=go.yourdomain.com... (the exact value will be provided to you on the AffEasy dashboard)

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="/images/domains/domain-verify.png"
    alt="Link Builder"
    width="1200"
    height="630"
  />
</Frame>

<Warning>
  If you are using this domain for another site, setting this TXT record may
  affect that site. Please exercise caution when setting this record. For
  example: Make sure that the domain shown in the TXT verification value (e.g.
  go.yourdomain.com) is actually the domain you want to use as a custom domain
  on AffEasy – and not your production site.
</Warning>

## How Long Do I Have to Wait for My Domain to Work?

Domain configuration can take anywhere between 1 to 24 hours to complete. If your domain still doesn't work after 24 hours, please [send us an email](mailto:support@affeasy.link) and we'll be happy to help you out.
