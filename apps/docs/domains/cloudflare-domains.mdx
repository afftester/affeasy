If you're using a domain on Cloudflare for your AffEasy workspace, you might need to configure a few extra steps to ensure that your domain works properly.

## Using Cloudflare's DNS Only (Recommended)

We recommend using Cloudflare's DNS only mode for your custom domain. This ensures that requests/clicks to your short links will always reach AffEasy directly instead of being served through Cloudflare â€“ which can lead to **inaccurate analytics data**.

Configuring Cloudflare as DNS only is also better for redirect speeds, since you avoid having your users' requests get proxied through Cloudflare, which adds additional latency.

To set this up, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Cloudflare dashboard and select your domain.
2. Click on the **DNS** tab on the sidebar menu.
3. Under **Records**, find the record pointing to AffEasy and click on the **Edit** button.
4. Change the **Proxy status** to **DNS only** (the cloud icon should be grey).
5. Click on the **Save** button.

  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="/images/domains/cloudflare-dns.png"
    alt="Set your domain's Proxy status to DNS only on Cloudflare"
    width="1200"
    height="630"
  />
</Frame>

This will ensure that the traffic to your domain is not proxied through Cloudflare and is sent directly to AffEasy.

## Using Cloudflare's Proxy

<Warning>
  Using Cloudflare's Proxy can potentially **cause inaccuracies in analytics
  data**. This is because using a proxy will send all traffic through the proxy
  first, then to AffEasy. This will result in incorrect geolocation data being
  presented and the public IP address of your proxy being sent.
</Warning>

If you still want to use Cloudflare's proxy for your custom domain, you'll need to make sure that your SSL/TLS encryption mode is set to "Full" on Cloudflare.

Follow these steps:

1. Go to your Cloudflare dashboard and select your domain.
2. Click on the **SSL/TLS** tab on the sidebar menu.
3. Under **Overview**, select the **Full** option.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="/images/domains/cloudflare-full.png"
    alt="SSL/TLS encryption mode set to Full on Cloudflare"
    width="1200"
    height="630"
  />
</Frame>

## Conclusion

To ensure the most accurate analytics and fastest redirect speeds, we recommend using **Cloudflare's DNS only mode** instead of their proxy. This configuration allows AffEasy to function optimally with your Cloudflare-managed domain.
