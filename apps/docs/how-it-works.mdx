## 1. Network Connection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connect Your Accounts" icon="plug">
    Users start by connecting their existing affiliate network accounts to
    AffEasy. This allows our platform to securely access and manage your
    affiliate partnerships in one place.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Brand Discovery" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Once connected, AffEasy automatically identifies which brands you have
    partnerships with across all your connected networks.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 2. Link Creation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Simplified Link Generation" icon="link">
    When you want to create an affiliate link, just go to your AffEasy
    dashboard, and paste the link. AffEasy automatically figures out which brand
    the link is for.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Automated Network Communication" icon="server">
    AffEasy then sends a request to the appropriate affiliate network on your
    behalf.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Instant Link Retrieval" icon="bolt">
    The affiliate network generates the link and sends it back to AffEasy, which
    is then presented to you.
  </Accordion>
