On AffEasy, a "Workspace" is a dedicated organizational unit designed to help you efficiently manage and categorize your affiliate marketing efforts. Here's what you need to know.

## Definition and Purpose

- A Workspace is a centralized hub where you can store, manage, and track all the affiliate short links related to a specific project, website, or business venture.
- It serves as a container for your affiliate marketing activities, allowing you to keep different aspects of your business separate and organized.

## Practical Application

For instance, if you're managing multiple affiliate websites or campaigns, you can create a separate workspace for each:

- Workspace 1: Tech Gadget Review Blog
- Workspace 2: Fitness Equipment Affiliate Site
- Workspace 3: Travel Deals Comparison Platform

This separation allows you to:

- Keep analytics and performance metrics distinct for each project
- Customize settings and domains specific to each venture
- Manage team access and permissions on a per-project basis

## How to Create a Workspace

To create a workspace:

1. Go to your [AffEasy dashboard](https://app.affeasy.link/)
2. Click on the **Create workspace** button

    alt="The workspace creation modal on AffEasy"
    width="300"
    height="150"
  />
</Frame>

In the workspace creation modal, you'll need to fill in these fields:

1. **Workspace Name**: The name of your workspace on AffEasy.
2. **Workspace Slug**: Your workspace's unique identifier on AffEasy.

Once you've filled in the fields, click on the **Create workspace** button.

## Onboarding Checklist

After creating your workspace, you'll be redirected to the workspace dashboard. Here, you'll see a checklist to help you get started:

1. **Configure your custom domain**: [Set up your own domain](/domains/add-custom-domain) for your affiliate short links.
2. **Create or import your links**: [Create a new affiliate link](/quickstart/guide) or import existing ones to your workspace.
3. **Invite your teammates**: Collaborate by inviting team members to join your workspace.

## Custom Domains in Workspaces

AffEasy allows you to [add custom domains](/domains/add-custom-domain) to your workspace. The number of domains you can add depends on your [plan](https://affeasy.link/pricing):

- **Free plan**: 3 domains
- **Pro plan**: 10 domains
- **Business plan**: 40 domains

If your workspace has multiple domains, you can filter links by their respective domains.

## Limits and Billing for Workspaces

On AffEasy, you can create multiple workspaces, with each workspace billed separately. However, to prevent abuse:

- You can create up to 2 workspaces on the Free plan.
- For more workspaces, you can [upgrade to the Pro plan](https://affeasy.link/pricing).
