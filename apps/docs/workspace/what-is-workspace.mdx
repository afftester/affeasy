# What is a "Workspace" on AffEasy?

Learn more about what a "Workspace" is on AffEasy and how you can use it to organize your affiliate links.

Last updated: September 5, 2024

## Understanding Workspaces

On AffEasy, a "Workspace" is a dedicated space where you can store and manage all the affiliate short links for your website, app, or business.

You can think of an AffEasy workspace as a "Team" or an "Organization" where you can **invite your teammates** to collaborate and manage the links together.

## How to Create a Workspace

To create a workspace:

1. Go to the **AffEasy Dashboard**
2. Click on the **Create workspace** button

    src="/images/workspace/create-workspace-modal.png"
    alt="The workspace creation modal on AffEasy"
    width="800"
    height="400"
  />
</Frame>

In the workspace creation modal, you'll need to fill in these fields:

1. **Workspace Name**: The name of your workspace on AffEasy.
2. **Workspace Slug**: Your workspace's unique identifier on AffEasy.

Once you've filled in the fields, click on the **Create workspace** button.

## Onboarding Checklist

After creating your workspace, you'll be redirected to the workspace dashboard. Here, you'll see a checklist to help you get started:

  />
</Frame>

1. **Configure your custom domain**: Set up your own domain for your affiliate short links.
2. **Create or import your links**: Add new affiliate links or import existing ones to your workspace.
3. **Invite your teammates**: Collaborate by inviting team members to join your workspace.

## Custom Domains in Workspaces

AffEasy allows you to add custom domains to your workspace. The number of domains you can add depends on your plan:

- **Free plan**: 3 domains
- **Pro plan**: 10 domains
- **Business plan**: 40 domains
- **Enterprise plan**: Unlimited domains

If your workspace has multiple domains, you can filter links by their respective domains:

    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="/images/workspace/domain-filtering.png"

  />
</Frame>

## Limits and Billing for Workspaces

On AffEasy, you can create multiple workspaces, with each workspace billed separately. However, to prevent abuse:

- You can create up to 2 workspaces on the Free plan.
- For more workspaces, you can [upgrade to the Pro plan](https://affeasy.link/pricing).
