AffEasy's link cloaking feature allows you to mask your destination URL with your short link, providing a cleaner and more branded experience for your users.

<Note>This feature is only available for **Pro plans and above**.</Note>

## Why use link cloaking?

Link cloaking offers several benefits:

- Enhance brand visibility by displaying your custom domain
- Maintain a consistent user experience across different links
- Protect affiliate links from being stripped or replaced
- Increase click-through rates with more trustworthy-looking links

## How to enable link cloaking

To use link cloaking for your AffEasy links, follow these steps:

1. Open the **link builder** in your AffEasy dashboard.
2. Enter your destination URL as usual.
3. Toggle the "Link Cloaking" switch to enable the feature.

  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="/images/link-cloaking/link-cloaking-toggle.png"
    alt="Toggling the 'Link Cloaking' switch in the link builder"
    width="600"
    height="400"
  />
</Frame>

Once enabled, your short link will be displayed in the user's browser address bar instead of the actual destination URL when they visit your link.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="/images/link-cloaking/link-cloaking-example.png"
    alt="Masking 'example.com' with 'aff.easy/example'"
    width="600"
    height="400"
  />
</Frame>

## Important considerations

When using link cloaking, keep the following points in mind:

1. **HTTPS requirement**: For link cloaking to work properly, ensure your destination URL uses `https`. If your destination URL uses `http`, the browser will show a "Not Secure" warning, and link cloaking may not function correctly.

2. **Website compatibility**: Link cloaking might not work for certain websites that have security measures in place to prevent framing. These measures include:
   - `X-Frame-Options` header set to `DENY`
   - `Content-Security-Policy` header set to `frame-ancestors 'none'`

<Note>
  If link cloaking doesn't work for a particular destination, AffEasy will
  automatically fall back to a standard redirect to ensure your links always
  function.

## Advanced link cloaking with AffEasy

AffEasy offers additional features to enhance your link cloaking experience:

### Custom subdomains

With AffEasy Pro, you can set up custom subdomains for your short links. This allows you to use your own branded domain (e.g., `go.yourbrand.com`) instead of the default AffEasy domain.

To set up a custom subdomain:

1. Go to the **Domains** section in your AffEasy dashboard.
2. Click on "Add Custom Domain" and follow the DNS setup instructions.
3. Once verified, you can use your custom domain when creating cloaked links.

### Link cloaking with the AffEasy API

For developers and advanced users, AffEasy provides API access to create cloaked links programmatically. Here's an example of how to create a cloaked link using the AffEasy API:

```typescript
import { AffEasy } from "affeasy";

const affeasy = new AffEasy();

await affeasy.links.create({
  url: "https://example.com/long-url",
  cloaking: true,
  customDomain: "go.yourbrand.com", // optional
});
```

## Combining link cloaking with other features

AffEasy allows you to combine link cloaking with other powerful features:

- **Geo targeting**: Create cloaked links that redirect to different URLs based on the user's location.
- **Device targeting**: Set up cloaked links that display different content depending on the user's device type.
- **Password protection**: Add an extra layer of security to your cloaked links by requiring a password.

## Measuring the impact of link cloaking

AffEasy provides detailed analytics to help you measure the effectiveness of your cloaked links. In your dashboard, you can view:

- Click-through rates for cloaked vs. non-cloaked links
- Engagement metrics for cloaked links
- Breakdown of traffic sources for cloaked links
