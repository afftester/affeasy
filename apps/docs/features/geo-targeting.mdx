AffEasy's geo targeting feature allows you to redirect users to different links based on their geographical location, enabling powerful location-based personalization for your marketing campaigns.

<Note>This feature is only available for **Pro plans and above**.</Note>

## Why use geo targeting?

Geo targeting is an invaluable tool for businesses operating in multiple regions or countries. It allows you to:

- Provide localized content or offers
- Redirect users to region-specific landing pages
- Comply with regional regulations or restrictions
- Optimize user experience based on location

## How to set up geo targeting

To use geo targeting for your AffEasy links, follow these steps:

1. Open the **link builder** in your AffEasy dashboard.
2. Set your main **Destination URL** (this will be used as a fallback for non-targeted locations).
3. Toggle the "Geo Targeting" switch to reveal targeting options.
4. For each location you want to target:
   a. Select the **Country** from the dropdown menu.
   b. Enter the **URL** for that specific country.
5. Click "Add location" to target additional countries.
6. Once you've added all desired locations, click "Create Link" to generate your geo-targeted link.

## How geo targeting works

When a user clicks on your AffEasy link with geo targeting enabled:

1. AffEasy detects the user's location based on their IP address.
2. If the user's country matches one of your specified locations, they are redirected to the corresponding URL.
3. If there's no match, or if the user's location can't be determined, they are sent to the main Destination URL.

## Advanced geo targeting with AI

AffEasy offers an AI-powered solution to enhance your geo targeting strategy. By clicking the `âœ¨` button in the link builder, you can access **AffEasy AI**, which analyzes global traffic patterns and suggests optimal geo targeting settings based on your link's content and target audience.

## Using geo targeting with the AffEasy API

For developers and advanced users, AffEasy provides API access to create geo-targeted links programmatically. To create a geo-targeted link using the API, include a `geo` field in your link creation request. The `geo` field should be an object with valid country codes as keys and their respective URLs as values.

Here's an example of how to create a geo-targeted link using the AffEasy API:

```typescript
import { AffEasy } from "affeasy";

const affeasy = new AffEasy();

await affeasy.links.create({
  url: "https://example.com", // fallback URL
  geo: {
    US: "https://example.com/us",
    GB: "https://example.com/uk",
    DE: "https://example.com/de",
  },
});
```

<Note>
  Make sure to use valid [ISO 3166-1
  alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) country codes as
  keys in the `geo` object.
</Note>

## Combining geo targeting with device targeting

For even more precise link customization, you can combine geo targeting with AffEasy's device targeting feature. This allows you to create links that direct users to different URLs based on both their geographical location and device type.

To set up combined geo and device targeting:

1. Enable geo targeting as described above.
2. In the link builder, also enable the "Device Targeting" option.
3. Set up your device targeting rules for different device types.
4. AffEasy will first check the user's location, then apply any relevant device targeting rules.

## Measuring the impact of geo targeting

AffEasy provides detailed analytics to help you measure the effectiveness of your geo targeting strategy. In your dashboard, you can view:

- Click-through rates for each targeted location
- Conversion rates for geo-targeted vs. non-targeted links
- Geographic distribution of clicks

Use these insights to continually refine your targeting strategy and optimize your marketing campaigns for different regions.
