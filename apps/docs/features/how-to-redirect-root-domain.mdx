When you add a custom domain to your AffEasy workspace, we automatically create a placeholder page for your domain. This guide will show you how to redirect your domain to a URL of your choice.

<Note>This feature is only available for **Pro plans and above**.</Note>

## Default Behavior

By default, when you visit your custom domain, you'll see a placeholder page created by AffEasy.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="/images/domains/placeholder-page.png"
    alt="Placeholder page for a custom domain on AffEasy"
    width="600"
    height="300"
  />
</Frame>

## Setting Up a Redirect

To redirect your domain to a URL of your choice, follow these steps:

1. If you haven't already, upgrade to the **Pro plan**.
2. Navigate to your workspace's Domains page by clicking on the **Domains** link in the menu bar at the top of your workspace dashboard.
3. Locate the domain you want to redirect and click on the `⋮` button next to it to open a dropdown menu.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="/images/domains/more-options-popover.png"
    alt="More options popover"
    width="300"
    height="200"
  />
</Frame>

4. In the dropdown menu, click on the **Edit Link** button. This will open the AffEasy link builder for the root domain link.
5. In the link builder, enter the URL you want to redirect your domain to in the **Destination URL** field.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="/images/domains/domain-settings-modal.png"
    alt="The 'Domain Settings' modal in AffEasy"
    width="600"
    height="400"
  />
</Frame>

6. Click "Save changes". Your root domain will now redirect to the URL you specified.
