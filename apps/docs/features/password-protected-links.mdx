AffEasy's password protection feature allows you to secure your short links, ensuring that only authorized recipients can access the destination URL. This guide will walk you through the process of creating password-protected links on AffEasy.

<Note>This feature is only available for **Pro plans and above**.</Note>

## Step 1: Create a link

1. Log into your AffEasy dashboard.
2. Click on the **Create Link** button in the top right corner of the dashboard.
3. Enter the destination URL and, if desired, a custom short link.

    src="/images/password-protection/create-link.png"
    alt="Create a link with the AffEasy link builder"
    width="600"
    height="400"
  />
</Frame>

## Step 2: Set a password

1. In the link builder, scroll down to the **Password Protection** section.
2. Toggle the switch to enable password protection.
3. Enter a password for the link.

    src="/images/password-protection/set-password.png"
    alt="Entering a password for the link"
    width="600"
    height="400"
  />
</Frame>

Once you've set a password, users who click on your link will be prompted to enter the password before accessing the destination URL.

    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="/images/password-protection/password-prompt.png"
    alt="An example of a password-protected page"
    width="600"
    height="400"
  />
</Frame>

## Step 3 (optional): Pass the password in the URL

For convenience, you can include the password as a query parameter in the URL. This allows automatic authentication and redirection to the destination URL.

Example:

- Password-protected link: **aff.easy/protected-link**
- Link with password included as a query parameter: **aff.easy/protected-link?pw=secretpass**

<Note>
  Be cautious when sharing links with embedded passwords, as they may be visible
  in browser history or server logs.
</Note>

## Step 4 (optional): Set a custom logo for the password page

For Pro plan users and above, you can customize the password page with your company's logo:

1. Go to your workspace settings by clicking on **Settings** in the top menu bar of your AffEasy dashboard.
2. Scroll to the **Workspace Logo** section.
3. Upload your company's logo (a square image is recommended for best results).

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="/images/password-protection/workspace-logo.png"
    alt="Workspace Logo section"
    width="600"
    height="400"
  />
</Frame>

Once set, your custom logo will automatically appear on the password page for all your protected links.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="/images/password-protection/custom-logo-page.png"
    alt="Password page with custom logo"
    width="600"
    height="400"
  />
</Frame>

## Advanced password protection features

AffEasy offers several advanced features to enhance your link security:

### Time-limited passwords

Set an expiration time for your passwords:

1. In the link builder, under Password Protection, enable "Time-limited Password".
2. Set the duration for which the password will be valid.

This is useful for temporary access or time-sensitive content.

### Multiple passwords

Create multiple valid passwords for a single link:

1. In the Password Protection section, click "Add Another Password".
2. Enter additional passwords as needed.

This allows you to provide different passwords to different groups or revoke access selectively.

### Password protection with AffEasy API

For developers and advanced users, AffEasy provides API access to create password-protected links programmatically. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { AffEasy } from "affeasy";

const affeasy = new AffEasy();

await affeasy.links.create({
  url: "https://example.com/confidential",
  password: "secretpass123",
  customDomain: "go.yourbrand.com", // optional
});
```

## Best practices for password-protected links

To make the most of AffEasy's password protection feature:

1. Use strong, unique passwords for each protected link.
2. Avoid sharing password-embedded URLs in public or unsecured channels.
3. Regularly update passwords for long-term protected links.
4. Combine password protection with link expiration for time-sensitive content.
5. Use custom logos to enhance brand recognition and user trust.
