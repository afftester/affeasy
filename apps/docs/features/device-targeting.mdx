AffEasy's device targeting feature allows you to customize the destination URL for your links based on the user's device type, providing a more personalized experience for your audience.

<Note>This feature is only available for **Pro plans and above**.</Note>

## Why use device targeting?

Device targeting is a powerful tool that can significantly enhance your marketing efforts and user experience. By tailoring the destination URL to specific device types, you can:

- Direct iOS users to the App Store and Android users to Google Play Store
- Provide device-specific landing pages or content
- Optimize user experience based on device capabilities

## How to set up device targeting

To use device targeting for your AffEasy links, follow these steps:

1. Open the **link builder** in your AffEasy dashboard.
2. Set your main **Destination URL** (this will be used as a fallback for non-targeted devices).
3. Toggle the "Device Targeting" switch to reveal targeting options.
4. Enable targeting for specific device types:

   a. **iOS Targeting**: Toggle this switch and enter a custom URL for iOS devices.

   b. **Android Targeting**: Toggle this switch and enter a custom URL for Android devices.

   c. **Desktop Targeting**: Toggle this switch and enter a custom URL for desktop devices.

## Advanced device targeting with AI

AffEasy also offers an AI-powered solution to enhance your device targeting strategy. By clicking the `âœ¨` button in the link builder, you can access **AffEasy AI**, which analyzes your destination URLs and suggests optimal targeting settings based on content and user behavior patterns.

## How device targeting works

When a user clicks on your AffEasy link, our system detects their device type and redirects them to the appropriate URL:

- If the user is on an iOS device, they'll be sent to the iOS-specific URL (if set).
- If the user is on an Android device, they'll be sent to the Android-specific URL (if set).
- If the user is on a desktop, they'll be sent to the desktop-specific URL (if set).
- For any other device type, or if a specific targeting rule isn't set, the user will be directed to the main Destination URL.

Here's a visual representation of how device targeting works:

## Bonus: Combining device targeting with geo-targeting

For even more precise link customization, you can combine device targeting with AffEasy's geo-targeting feature. This allows you to create links that direct users to different URLs based on both their device type and geographical location.

To set up combined device and geo-targeting:

1. Enable device targeting as described above.
2. In the link builder, also enable the "Geo Targeting" option.
3. Set up your geo-targeting rules for different countries or regions.
4. AffEasy will first check the user's device type, then apply any relevant geo-targeting rules.

```typescript
import { AffEasy } from "affeasy";

const affeasy = new AffEasy();

await affeasy.links.create({
  url: "https://example.com", // fallback URL
  deviceTargeting: {
    ios: "https://apps.apple.com/app/your-app",
    android: "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=your.app",
  },
  geoTargeting: {
    US: "https://example.com/us",
    UK: "https://example.com/uk",
  },
});
```

<Note>
  The order of precedence is: Device Targeting > Geo Targeting > Default URL.
  Make sure to plan your targeting strategy accordingly.
