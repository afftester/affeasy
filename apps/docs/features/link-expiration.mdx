AffEasy allows you to set expiration dates for your links, giving you more control over the lifespan of your short URLs.

<Note>This feature is only available for **Pro plans and above**.</Note>

## How to set an expiration date for your links

To set an expiration date for your AffEasy links, follow these steps:

1. Open the **link builder** in your AffEasy dashboard.
2. Toggle the "Link Expiration" switch to reveal the expiration options.
3. You can set the expiration date in two ways:
   a. Use natural language: Type in any time interval, such as "in 2 hours" or "tomorrow at 5PM". AffEasy will automatically convert this to the correct date-time format.
   b. Use the date-time picker: Manually select the date and time from the provided calendar and time selector.

When a user tries to access an expired link, they will see an "Expired Link" page.

<Note>
  Clicks to the link after the expiration date will ***not*** be tracked in your
  analytics.
</Note>

## Setting a custom expiration URL

You can redirect users to a specific page when a link expires by setting a custom expiration URL:

1. In the link builder, under the **Link Expiration** section, locate the **Expiration URL** field.
2. Enter the custom URL you want users to be redirected to when the link expires.

## Setting a default expiration URL for all links under a domain

For consistency across your links, you can set a default expiration URL for all links under a specific domain:

1. Go to the **AffEasy dashboard**.
2. Click on the **Domains** tab in the top navigation bar.
3. Find the domain you want to set the default expiration URL for and click the `â‹®` button to open the dropdown menu.

    alt="More options popover for domain settings"
    width="400"
    height="300"
  />
</Frame>

4. Click on the **Edit** button in the dropdown menu to open the **Edit domain** modal.
5. Toggle the **Advanced options** section.
6. In the **Default Expiration URL** field, enter the URL you want to redirect users to when any link under this domain expires.

  />

7. Click on the **Save changes** button to apply the settings.

## Advanced expiration features

AffEasy offers several advanced features to enhance your link expiration strategy:

### Gradual expiration

Instead of a hard cutoff, you can set up a gradual expiration process:

1. In the link builder, enable "Gradual Expiration" under the Link Expiration section.
2. Set multiple expiration stages, each with its own redirect URL and expiration time.

This allows you to create a staged expiration process, useful for phasing out campaigns or managing time-sensitive content.

### Expiration notifications

Set up notifications to alert you before your links expire:

1. In your AffEasy dashboard, go to **Settings** > **Notifications**.
2. Enable "Link Expiration Alerts" and set your preferred notification time (e.g., 24 hours before expiration).

### API support for link expiration

For developers and advanced users, AffEasy provides API access to set link expiration programmatically. Here's an example of how to create a link with an expiration date using the AffEasy API:

```typescript
import { AffEasy } from "affeasy";

const affeasy = new AffEasy();

await affeasy.links.create({
  url: "https://example.com/limited-offer",
  expiresAt: "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z",
  expirationUrl: "https://example.com/offer-ended",
});
```

## Best practices for using link expiration

To make the most of the link expiration feature, consider these best practices:

1. Use expiration dates for time-sensitive campaigns or limited-time offers.
2. Set meaningful expiration URLs that provide value to users who click expired links.
3. Regularly review and update your expired links to maintain a clean link inventory.
4. Combine link expiration with other features like geo-targeting or device targeting for more sophisticated campaigns.
5. Use the gradual expiration feature for important links to create a smooth transition.
