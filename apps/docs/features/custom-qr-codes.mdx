QR codes are a powerful way to share your short links in physical spaces or digital media. At AffEasy, we offer customizable QR codes to enhance your brand recognition and engagement.

## Custom QR Code Availability

<Note>Custom QR codes are available for **Pro plans and above**.</Note>

As a freemium product, we rely on word of mouth to spread the word about AffEasy. Therefore, on AffEasy's free plan, you can only use the default QR code design for your short links.

  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="/images/qr-codes/default-qr-code.png"
    alt="Default QR Code on AffEasy"
    width="300"
    height="300"
  />
</Frame>

If you'd like to customize your QR codes or remove the AffEasy logo, please consider **upgrading to a Pro plan** to support us. Thank you!

## How to Set a Custom QR Code Logo

Once you're on a Pro plan or above, you can set a custom QR code for your short links. Your QR code logo is connected to your workspace's logo on AffEasy.

To set a custom QR code, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your workspace settings page by clicking on the **Settings** link in the menu bar at the top of your workspace dashboard.
2. Scroll down to the **Workspace Logo** section.
3. Upload your company's logo. We recommend using a square image for the best results.

  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="/images/qr-codes/workspace-logo-section.png"
    alt="Workspace Logo section"
    width="600"
    height="300"
  />
</Frame>

Once you've set your workspace's logo, your QR code will automatically update to use your custom logo.

  <img
    className="rounded-lg border border-gray-100"
    src="/images/qr-codes/custom-qr-code.png"
    alt="Custom QR Code logo"
    width="300"
    height="300"
  />
</Frame>

## Customizing QR Code Colors

With a Pro plan or above, you can also customize the colors of your QR code to match your brand:

1. Go to the QR Code section in your workspace settings.
2. Use the color picker to choose your desired foreground and background colors.
3. Preview your customized QR code in real-time.

## Best Practices for QR Codes

To ensure your QR codes are effective:

1. **Maintain contrast**: Ensure there's enough contrast between the foreground and background colors for easy scanning.
2. **Test thoroughly**: Always test your QR codes on various devices before publishing.
3. **Provide context**: When displaying QR codes, include a brief description of where they lead.
